# Gisele-full-version

The GIS for electrification (GISEle) tool was developed as an effort to improve the planning of rural electrification in developing countries. It is an open source Python-based tool that uses GIS and terrain analysis to model the area under study, groups loads using a density-based clustering algorithm called DBSCAN and then it uses graph theory to find the least-costly electric network topology that can connect all the people in the area. 

The methodology of GISEle consists in three main steps: data analysis, clustering and grid routing. During the initial phase of data gathering and analysis, GIS data sets are created in order to properly map several information about the area to be electrified. Some of these information are: population density, elevation, slope and roads. They are all processed using a weighting strategy that translates the topological aspect of the terrain to the difficulty of line deployment. Then, DBSCAN is used to strategically aggregates groups of people in small areas called clusters. The output is a set number of clusters, partially covering the initial area considered, in which the grid routing algorithm is performed. Finally, GISEle uses the concept of Steiner tree to create a network topology connecting all the aggregated people in each cluster, and then, if necessary, it makes use of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to connect each cluster grid into an existing distribution network.
